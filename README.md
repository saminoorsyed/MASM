# MASM
a repo to showcase a few Microsoft Macro Assembly language projects that I built using the IRVING library.

The code the I wrote is in the .asm files in both folders.

Macros And Procs:

A Microsoft Macro Assembly program that I wrote for my Oregon state university class on computer architecture. This program makes use of Macros and Procedures to prompt users for 10 signed and unsigned integers, and then display those integers in an array along with their sum and truncated average.

Passing Params:

a Microsoft Macro assembly program that I wrote in the winter of 2022 in order to familiarize my self with parameter passing, base + offset referencing and the merge sort algorithm. It was fun getting to know how my computer works at a very low level!
